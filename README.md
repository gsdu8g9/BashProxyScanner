Bash Proxy Scanner
==================

This little script goes through the 192.168.0.0/16 Proxy Range and checks for working proxies on a Network Connection. The code might be a little noobish, but it gets the work done.

### Why?

In my College, we have to access the Internet through a given proxy that caps our connection speed and blocks many Social and, ahem, other sites as well, while the head professors get to browse the internet freely on the same network. It wasn't too hard to guess that they were using special proxies assigned to them.

Well, don't I deserve to browse the internet freely too? And maybe torrent a couple of movies at high speeds while I'm at it.


### I mean't WHY not use so many existing apps? 

Right. You don't want to hear my rants. Well, I took this as a chance to learn a little about Bash and a few Linux Commands such as `wget`. If you don't like it, go fuck yourself.


Using the Script
----------------

1. Clone the Repo
